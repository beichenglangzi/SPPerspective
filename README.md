## Requirements

Swift `+5.0`. Ready for use on iOS 12+

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. It’s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

To integrate `SPPerspective` into your Xcode project using Xcode 12, specify it in `File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency...`:

```ogdl
https://github.com/ivanvorobei/SPPerspective
```

### CocoaPods:

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate `SPPerspective` into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'SPPerspective'
```

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of dependency managers, you can integrate `SPPerspective` into your project manually. Put `Source/SPPerspective` folder in your Xcode project. Make sure to enable `Copy items if needed` and `Create groups`.

## Usage

### Widget iOS 14

You can set widgets style with one line code:

```swift
whiteView.applyPerspectiveAnimation(.iOS14Widget)
```
That all. It automatically added shadow and 3D transform animation.

### Custom Configuration

For deep customize need create config file. It object of `SPPerspectiveAnimationConfig`.

```swift
let config = SPPerspectiveAnimationConfig(
    animationDuration: 2,
    distortionPerspective: 600,
    angle: 10,
    vectorStep: 3.14,
    shadowConfig: nil
)
```

Also you can configure shadow. For it need pass `SPPerspectiveShadowConfig` to your  `SPPerspectiveAnimationConfig`.
You can read about each value in documentation.
